## Goal of the Competition
The National Football League (NFL) has tasked contestants to use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. 


## 2023 Theme: Linemen on Pass Plays
Quarterbacks may get the glory, but some of the most important work takes place a few feet in front of them. The offensive line protects the passer, providing precious seconds to find receivers downfield. At the same time, the opposing team’s defensive line attempts to find a disruptive path. If a defender sneaks through, it can mean a sack, a blocked pass, or even a turnover. Some of the game’s most important plays happen on the line and this competition examines the data behind the hardest workers in football.

Notebook submissions will be scored based on five components: innovation, accuracy, relevance, clarity, and data visualization.
